<h1>Learning: Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling and Once</h1>
<li>Nothing too cool here just learning more to do with event listners</li>
<li>Using capture:true runs the function on the way down the nested tags rather than on the way up </li>
<li>Once: true listens for the event instance and then unbinds it right away (like .removeEventListner)</li>
<li>Bubbling is where the handler is run on the element and then also its parents and futher ancestors </li>
<li>.stopPropogation stops the event from bubbling and just runs on the single element</li>
